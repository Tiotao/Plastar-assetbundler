        <coolfact>The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus withstood many city invasions until it was finally destroyed by an earthquake in 1404.</coolfact>
        <description>Now that the Castle of Bodrum is finished, it makes a nice city attraction. Started in 1406, it took 500 years to finish. Walking in it, you'll find pieces of marble within the walls. Rumors of a turkish invasion led to taking marble from the ruins of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, and use them for fortification. </description>
