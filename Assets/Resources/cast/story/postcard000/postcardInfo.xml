        <description>Nautical lovers should check out the city's bay area. Located off the Aegean Sea, our last King, Mausolus, enhanced it as a defence tool. The ports help block a channel that enemy ships could use, and the dredged sand from deepening the harbor is now used to protect breakwaters. </description>
