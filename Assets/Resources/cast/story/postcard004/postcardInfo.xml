        <coolfact>Historians can trace back the term 'Mausoleum' to the tomb of King Mausolus, as a derivative of his name.</coolfact>
        <description>During your stay in Bodrum, Turkey, stop by the ruins of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. One of seven ancient world wonders, you can see it's remaining foundation on site. Afterwards, stop by Bodrum Castle; you can still see the marble used for fortification that was taken from the mausoleum.  </description>
